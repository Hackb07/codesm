Find past conversation threads using a query DSL.

## What this tool finds

This tool searches through your past conversation sessions (threads) to find relevant discussions, solutions, or code changes you've worked on before.

## Query syntax

- **Keywords**: Bare words or quoted phrases for text search: `auth` or `"race condition"`
- **File filter**: `file:path` to find threads that touched a file: `file:src/auth/login.py`
- **Topic filter**: `topic:name` to scope to a topic category: `topic:bugfix` or `topic:feature`
- **Date filters**: `after:date` and `before:date` to filter by date: `after:2024-01-15`, `after:7d`, `before:2w`
- **Combine filters**: Use implicit AND: `auth file:src/foo.py topic:security after:7d`

All matching is case-insensitive. File paths use partial matching. Date formats: ISO dates (`2024-01-15`), relative days (`7d`), weeks (`2w`), or months (`1m`).

## Available topics

feature, bugfix, refactor, docs, testing, config, review, research, planning, devops, performance, security, ui, api, database, other

## When to use this tool

- "Find threads where we discussed the authentication system"
- "What thread last changed the database schema?"
- "Find threads about performance optimization from last week"
- "Show me recent bugfix threads"

## When NOT to use this tool

- If you need the actual content/context from a thread → use `read_thread` after finding it
- For searching code in files → use `grep` or `finder`
