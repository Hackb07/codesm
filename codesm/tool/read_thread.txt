Read and extract relevant context from a past conversation thread.

This tool fetches a thread by ID, analyzes its content, and uses AI to extract only the information relevant to your specific goal. This keeps context concise while preserving important details.

## When to use this tool

- After using `find_thread` to locate a relevant thread
- When you need to apply the same approach from a past conversation
- When you want to extract specific patterns, code, or decisions from a thread
- When the user says "do what we did in thread X"

## When NOT to use this tool

- When you don't have a thread ID - use `find_thread` first
- When working within the current thread (context is already available)

## Parameters

- **thread_id**: The session identifier (format: `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_ffffff`)
- **goal**: A clear description of what information you're looking for. Be specific.
