Find the root cause of an error given a stack trace, error message, or symptom description.

## What it does
1. **Parses stack traces** - Extracts file paths, line numbers, function calls
2. **Reads relevant files** - Automatically loads files mentioned in the error
3. **Searches codebase** - Finds related code patterns and definitions
4. **Analyzes with AI** - Correlates information to identify root cause
5. **Suggests fixes** - Provides concrete steps to resolve the issue

## Parameters
- `error` (required): Stack trace, error message, or symptom description
- `context`: Additional context (what you were doing, recent changes)
- `files`: Specific files to examine

## Output
- **Error Analysis**: What the error means
- **Root Cause**: Most likely location with confidence level
- **Related Locations**: Other files that may be involved
- **Suggested Fix**: Concrete steps to fix
- **Investigation Commands**: Additional debugging steps if needed

## Examples

Analyze a Python stack trace:
```json
{"error": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"app.py\", line 42, in handler\n    result = process(data)\nTypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable"}
```

With additional context:
```json
{
  "error": "Connection refused on port 5432",
  "context": "Started happening after deploying new config changes"
}
```

Analyze specific files:
```json
{
  "error": "Tests fail with 'undefined is not a function'",
  "files": ["src/utils.js", "tests/utils.test.js"]
}
```
