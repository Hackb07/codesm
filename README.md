## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uv pip install -e .

# Run
codesm

# Or with uv directly
uv run codesm
```

## Agent Modes

codesm supports two agent modes for different task types:

### Smart Mode (Default)
- Uses powerful models (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o)
- Best for complex tasks, architecture decisions, debugging
- Full capability, thorough reasoning

### Rush Mode
- Uses fast models (Claude Haiku 3.5, GPT-4o-mini)
- **67% cheaper, 50% faster**
- Best for simple, well-defined tasks: quick edits, small fixes, simple features

**Switch modes:**
- Press `tab` to toggle between modes
- Use `/rush` or `/smart` commands
- Use `/mode` to open mode selector

## Providers

### Supported Providers
