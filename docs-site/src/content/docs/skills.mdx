# React Development

When creating React components:

1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Follow the component structure:
   - Props interface
   - Component function
   - Styled components or CSS modules
3. Include proper TypeScript types
4. Add JSDoc comments

## File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `useCamelCase.ts`
- Utils: `camelCase.ts`

## Example Component

\`\`\`tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

export function Button({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {label}
    </button>
  );
}
\`\`\`
```
