[**codesm**](/) is an open source AI coding agent built with Python. It's available as a terminal-based interface with a beautiful TUI powered by Textual.

<div class="terminal-demo">
  <div class="terminal-header">
    <span class="terminal-button close"></span>
    <span class="terminal-button minimize"></span>
    <span class="terminal-button maximize"></span>
    <span class="terminal-title">codesm | Homepage button color change</span>
  </div>
  <div class="terminal-body">
    <div><span class="prompt">#</span> <span class="command">Homepage button color change workflow</span></div>
    <br/>
    <div><span class="output">Find the homepage button and make it blue</span></div>
    <br/>
    <div><span class="output">I'll search for the homepage button in the codebase.</span></div>
    <div><span class="output">• Grep "homepage|home.*button|Home.*button"</span></div>
    <div><span class="output">• Grep "Homepage"</span></div>
    <br/>
    <div><span class="output">Let me search more broadly for buttons and home-related elements:</span></div>
    <div><span class="output">• Grep "Home" (18 matches)</span></div>
    <div><span class="output">• Glob "**/*.tsx" (100 matches)</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

Let's get started.

#### Prerequisites

To use codesm, you'll need:

1. Python 3.11 or later
2. A modern terminal emulator like:
   - [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), cross-platform
   - [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), cross-platform
   - [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), Linux and macOS
   - [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), Linux and macOS

3. API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.

---

## Install

Install codesm using pip or uv:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pip">
  ```bash
  pip install codesm
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="uv">
  ```bash
  uv pip install codesm
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="pipx">
  ```bash
  pipx install codesm
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codesm/codesm.git
cd codesm
uv sync
```

---

## Configure

With codesm you can use various LLM providers by configuring their API keys.

1. Set up your provider API key:

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   # or
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   # or
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

2. Optionally, create a config file at `~/.config/codesm/config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "provider": "anthropic",
     "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
   }
   ```

[Learn more about providers](/docs/providers).

---

## Initialize

Navigate to a project you want to work on:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

And run codesm:

```bash
codesm
```

Initialize codesm for your project by running:

```bash frame="none"
/init
```

This analyzes your project and creates an `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.

:::tip
You should commit your project's `AGENTS.md` file to Git.
:::

---

## Usage

You are now ready to use codesm! Here are some examples:

---

### Ask questions

Ask codesm to explain the codebase:

:::tip
Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.
:::

```txt frame="none"
How is authentication handled in @src/auth/index.ts
```

---

### Add features

Ask codesm to add new features:

1. **Create a plan**

   Switch to Plan mode using the **Tab** key.

   ```txt frame="none"
   When a user deletes a note, flag it as deleted in the database.
   Then create a screen that shows all recently deleted notes.
   ```

2. **Build the feature**

   Switch back to Build mode and ask it to implement:

   ```txt frame="none"
   Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
   ```

---

### Make changes

For straightforward changes:

```txt frame="none"
Add authentication to the /settings route. Look at how it's
handled in @src/api/notes.ts and implement the same logic.
```

---

### Undo changes

Undo changes with `/undo`:

```bash frame="none"
/undo
```

Or redo with `/redo`:

```bash frame="none"
/redo
```
