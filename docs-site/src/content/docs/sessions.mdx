title: Sessions
description: Managing conversation sessions in codesm.
---

Sessions are the core unit of conversation state in codesm.

---

## What is a Session?

A session contains:
- Your conversation history
- Tool call results
- File changes made
- Context and state

Sessions are stored locally and can be resumed later.

---

## Managing Sessions

### List Sessions

View all sessions for the current project:

```bash frame="none"
/sessions
```

Or use the keybind: `ctrl+x l`

### New Session

Start a fresh session:

```bash frame="none"
/new
```

### Resume Session

Select a session from the list or resume by ID:

```bash
codesm --session <session-id>
```

### Continue Last Session

```bash
codesm --continue
```

---

## Session Storage

Sessions are stored in:

```
~/.local/share/codesm/storage/
├── session/{project-id}/{session-id}.json
├── message/{session-id}/{message-id}.json
└── part/{message-id}/{part-id}.json
```

### Backup Sessions

```bash
cp -r ~/.local/share/codesm/storage ~/codesm-backup
```

### Clear Old Sessions

```bash
# Clear sessions older than 30 days
codesm sessions clear --older-than 30d
```

---

## Context Management

### Compaction

When context grows too large, use `/compact`:

```bash frame="none"
/compact
```

This summarizes the conversation while preserving key information.

### Token Limits

codesm automatically manages context to stay within model limits:

| Model | Context Limit |
|-------|---------------|
| Claude 4 | 200K tokens |
| GPT-4.1 | 128K tokens |
| Llama 3.1 | 128K tokens |

---

## Export & Share

### Export to Markdown

Export the current session:

```bash frame="none"
/export
```

This opens the conversation in your `$EDITOR`.

### Share (Coming Soon)

Share sessions with your team:

```bash frame="none"
/share
```

---

## Undo/Redo

Sessions track file changes for undo/redo:

### Undo

Revert the last message and any file changes:

```bash frame="none"
/undo
```

:::tip
Your project must be a Git repository for undo to work.
:::

### Redo

Restore undone changes:

```bash frame="none"
/redo
```

---

## Session Forking

Fork a session to explore different approaches:

```bash frame="none"
/fork
```

This creates a new session with the same context.
