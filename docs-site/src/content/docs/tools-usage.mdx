title: Tools
description: Understanding the tools codesm uses.
---

codesm uses tools to interact with your codebase. The agent decides which tools to use based on your request.

---

## Core Tools

### read

Read file contents:

```txt frame="none"
Read the config file at src/config.py
```

The agent will use the `read` tool to fetch file contents.

### write

Create new files:

```txt frame="none"
Create a new test file for the User model
```

### edit

Modify existing files:

```txt frame="none"
Add error handling to the login function
```

### bash

Execute shell commands:

```txt frame="none"
Run the tests for the auth module
```

:::caution
Bash commands require approval by default. See [Permissions](/docs/permissions).
:::

## Search Tools

### grep

Search for patterns:

```txt frame="none"
Find all uses of the deprecated API
```

### glob

Find files by pattern:

```txt frame="none"
Find all Python test files
```

### finder

Semantic code search:

```txt frame="none"
Find where user authentication is implemented
```

---

## Intelligence Tools

### oracle

Get expert advice for complex problems:

```txt frame="none"
Review the authentication architecture
```

The oracle is a secondary LLM that helps with planning and debugging.

### refactor

Get refactoring suggestions:

```txt frame="none"
Suggest improvements for src/utils.py
```

### code_review

Review code changes:

```txt frame="none"
Review my staged changes
```

---

## Task Management

### task

Spawn sub-agents for parallel work:

```txt frame="none"
Implement the API and UI in parallel
```

### todo

Track items during a session:

```txt frame="none"
Add "write tests" to the todo list
```

---

## Tool Visibility

See what tools the agent is using with `/details`:

```bash frame="none"
/details
```

This toggles detailed tool execution output:

```txt
• Read src/auth.py (245 lines)
• Grep "authenticate" (3 matches)
• Edit src/auth.py:45-52
```

---

## Tool Permissions

Control which tools require approval:

```json title="codesm.json"
{
  "permissions": {
    "tools": {
      "read": "allow",
      "edit": "ask",
      "bash": "ask",
      "write": "ask"
    }
  }
}
```

Options:
- `allow` - Always allow
- `ask` - Ask for approval
- `deny` - Never allow

See [Permissions](/docs/permissions) for more details.
