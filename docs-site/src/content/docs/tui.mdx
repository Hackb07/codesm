import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

codesm provides an interactive terminal interface (TUI) for working on your projects with an LLM.

Running codesm starts the TUI for the current directory:

```bash
codesm
```

Or start it for a specific directory:

```bash
codesm /path/to/project
```

---

## File References

Reference files in your messages using `@`. This does a fuzzy file search:

:::tip
Use `@` to quickly reference files in your prompts.
:::

```txt frame="none"
How is auth handled in @src/auth/index.ts?
```

The content of the file is automatically added to the conversation.

---

## Bash Commands

Start a message with `!` to run a shell command:

```bash frame="none"
!ls -la
```

The output is added to the conversation as a tool result.

---

## Slash Commands

Type `/` followed by a command name to execute actions:

```bash frame="none"
/help
```

## Modes

codesm has two modes, switchable with **Tab**:

### Build Mode (Default)

The agent can read and write files, run commands, and make changes.

### Plan Mode

The agent can only read files and suggest changes. Use this for:
- Understanding unfamiliar code
- Planning complex changes
- Getting explanations without modifications

## Input Modes

### Normal Input

Type your message and press **Enter** to send.

### Multi-line Input

Press **Shift+Enter** for a new line, or use the editor command.

### External Editor

Use `/editor` or `ctrl+x e` to compose in your `$EDITOR`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linux/macOS">
  ```bash
  export EDITOR="code --wait"
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Windows">
  ```powershell
  $env:EDITOR = "code --wait"
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
